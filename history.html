        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Lee Restaurant was born from the vision of my parents and older siblings, who saw an opportunity to create a business rooted in our Hmong heritage. As the Hmong community continued to grow in Milwaukee, opening a restaurant that showcased our traditional cuisine felt like a meaningful addition to the local landscape.</p>

        <p>When we first opened our doors in 2019, the grand opening was a momentous occasion. We celebrated by offering complimentary bowls of pho, which introduced many new customers to the authentic flavors of our culture. The community response was overwhelmingly positive, and Lee Restaurant quickly became a cherished part of the local dining scene.</p>

        <p>Like many businesses, we faced challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. While we stayed open for as long as possible, the extended quarantine eventually forced us to close temporarily. However, once the pandemic settled down, we were able to relocate to a new space within HmongTown, a Hmong-owned marketplace. Our loyal customers, who had supported us from the beginning, returned once more, helping us re-establish ourselves in the community.</p>

        <p>Our presence in the community goes beyond food. We’ve served as a gathering place for families, friends, and organizations, providing a space where cultural traditions are celebrated and shared. Whether through catering for local events, supporting Hmong festivals, or offering a welcoming environment for our neighbors, Lee Restaurant continues to bring people together.</p>

        <p>Through the ups and downs, we’ve been inspired by the loyalty and support from our customers. Their dedication during difficult times, particularly through the pandemic, reminds us of the importance of staying connected to our roots and community. As we look to the future, we remain committed to not only serving delicious, traditional meals but also contributing to the strength and unity of the Hmong community in Milwaukee.</p>

        <p>Today, Lee Restaurant continues to stand as a cornerstone of traditional Hmong cuisine in Milwaukee. We take pride in serving the dishes that represent our heritage, and we are grateful to be part of a vibrant community that has embraced us since day one.</p>
