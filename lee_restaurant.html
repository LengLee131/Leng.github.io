        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <p>At Lee Restaurant, we’re committed to serving more than just meals — we deliver a culinary experience rooted in the traditions of the Hmong community. Our dishes are carefully crafted using authentic cooking techniques, fresh local ingredients, and family recipes that have been passed down through generations.</p>

        <p>What sets us apart is the balance of flavor and soul in every dish. We slow-simmer our broths for hours, hand-select herbs and spices for every plate, and make each serving to order to ensure quality and freshness. Our Crispy Pork Belly is known for its perfect crunch and rich flavor, while our Pho offers deep, aromatic broth paired with tender cuts of meat and fresh garnishes.</p>

        <p>We also take pride in our warm and inviting service. Whether you're a first-time customer or a regular, you'll be treated like family from the moment you walk through the door. Our team is here to answer questions about Hmong cuisine and help you find dishes you'll love — whether you're seeking bold spice or comforting simplicity.</p>

        <p>Our menu is a celebration of heritage, taste, and community. Every meal is an opportunity to experience the heart of Hmong culture through food — lovingly made, thoughtfully served, and genuinely shared.</p>
